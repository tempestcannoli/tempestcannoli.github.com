  <h2>Dogs</h2>
  <p> "The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf, characterized by an upturning tail. </p>
    <p> The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. </p>
    <p>The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by hunter--gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture.</p>
    <p>Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet </p>
    <p>that would be inadequate for other canids. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, </p>
    <p>and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.</p>
    <p>The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. </p>
    <p>Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, </p>
    <p>assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend."</p>
